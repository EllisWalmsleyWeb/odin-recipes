    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Steak and eggs is a dish of beefsteak and fried eggs. Originating in Australian cuisine, it is most typically served as a breakfast or brunch food.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thin steak</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Garnish of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> Start by seasoning the steak and grilling it. Generally speaking, you should grill it for about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare, or a total of 3 minutes in a dual-contact grill. If you're using a strip steak, you should also briefly cook the fat strip.</li>
        <li>If you're pan-frying the steak and are aiming for medium-rare, you'll need to cook it for 2-3 minutes per side over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Fry the eggs. While the meat is resting, quickly fry the eggs in butter or avocado oil.</li>
        <li>Season and serve. Season the dish with salt, black pepper, and your chosen garnish, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
